# Hike Tracker

This application allows for users to track their **hikes** while rating them 
and being able to see their **accomplishments** such as total elevation climbed and
distance.
This is intended for users who like to hike frequently and would like to
track their hikes *easily* and see a list of their accomplishments.

I am interested in this project because I enjoy hiking and have been
keeping track in a journal, but now I have been inspired to create an application
that has that functionality while giving me new statistics and the ability to 
view my hikes easily.
